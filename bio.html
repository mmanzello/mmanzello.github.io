	<p> My name is Melissa Manzello and I am 19 years old. I was born in Long Island, NY and have lived here my whole life until college. I have three siblings who range in age quite drastially considering there is a seventeen year difference between my oldest brother and youngest brother. I have played sports since I was around the age of three, but one sport really clicked for me around age eight. I have played field hockey for eleven years now and play on the team at Tufts University. I plan on studying Economics and Film and Media Studies as a double major at Tufts, while minoring in Computer Science. I am apart of Tufts Financial Group, and I hope to join more clubs during my time at Tufts. I enjoy spending my free time listening to music, reading, and going to the beach. I also enjoy attending sporting events and food fairs. My absolute love in this world is traveling and experiencing different cultures, and I inted on spending one year of my life just traveling the world. </p>
